###### Measuring Supply Chain Performance
Percentage invested in ventory=Total inventory investment/Total assets*100

Inventory Turnover(week of supply):    
Inventory turnover=cost of goods sole/inventory investment    
Inventory investment is the average inventory value for the same period. This may be the average of several periods of inventory or beginning and ending inventory added together and divided by two.

Weeks of supply, may have more meaning in the wholesale and retail portions of the service sector than in manufacturing.    
Week of supply= inventory investment/Annual cost of goods sole/52 weeks

###### A bullwhip effect measure 
Bullwhip=variance of orders/variance of demand

Variance amplification is present if the bullwhip measure is greater than 1. This means the size of a company's orders fluctuates more than the size of its incoming demand. If the measure equals 1, then no amplification is present. A value less than 1 would imply a smoothing or dampening scenario as orders move up the supply chain towards suppliers.
