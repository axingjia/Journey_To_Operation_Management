# Chapter 1: Operation and Productivity
* design product, test, and analyze for cost of ingredient
* labor requirement 
* customer satisfaction
* production upon approval, only when the ingredients are available from qualified suppliers 
* receiving, cold storage, grilling or baking or frying
* use the best people they can recruit and train 
* prepare effective employee schedules
* Design efficient layouts

* [def]Production is creation of goods and services
* [def]Operations Management is the set of activities that creates value in the form of goods and services by transforming input into output
* it can be a good, like a Sony TV or a Harley-Davidson motocycle, or a service, like the transfer of funds from a saving account to a chequing account, the transplant of a human organ, the filling of an empty seat on an airplane, or the education of a student

* To create goods and services, all organizations perform three functions. These funcitons are the necessary ingredients not only for production but also for an organization's survival: 1. Marketing, which generates the demand, or at least takes the order for a product or service; 2. Production/operation: which creates, produces, and delivers the product; 3. Finance/accounting: tracks how well the organization is doing, pays the bills, and collects the money
* [def]supply chain is a global network of organizations and activities that supply a firm with goods and services
* [CL]: Competition in the 21st century is no longer between companies, it is between supply chains
* All good managers perform the basic functions of the management process. The management process consists of planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling.

###### 10 Critical Decisions of Operations Management 
1. Design of goods and services: what good or service should we offer? How should we design these products
2. Managing quality: How do we define the quality? Who is responsible for quality.
3. Process and capacity design: What process and what capacity will these products require? What equipment and technology are necessary for these processes?
4. Location Strategy: Where should we put the facility? On what criteria should we base the location decision?
5. Layout strategy: How should we arrange the facility? How large much the facility be to meet our plan?
6. Human resources and job design: how do we provide a reasonable work environment? How much can we expect our employees to produce?
7. Supply Chain Management: Should we make or buy this component? who should be our suppliers, and how can we integrate them into our strategy?
8. Inventory, material requirements planning and JIT(just in time): How much inventory of each item should we have? When do we reorder?
9. Intermediate and short-term scheduling: Are we better off keeping people on the payroll udring slowdowns? Which job do we perform next?
10. Maintenance: Who is responsible for maintenance?

Frederick W. Taylor believes that management should assume more responsibility for:
1. Matching employees to the right job 
2. Provide the proper training
3. Providing proper work methods and tools
4. Establishing legitimate incentive for work to be accomplished.

###### Operations in the Service Sector
* [def] services example: repair and maintenance, government, food and lodging, transportation, insruance, trade, financial, real estate, education, law, medicine, entertainment, health services.
* There is no stored inventory. Therefore, there is no inventory problem in service 
* Service have high customer interaction.
* Services are often knowledge based
* Services are frequently dispersed.

# Chapter 2: Operations Strategy in a Global Environment 
Boeing with new airplane, new design and new engine. Its airplane is built all around the world. Because of that, it raises a huge financial risk of over $5 billion dollars. Because of that Boeing needs partners. It means finding exceptional developers and suppliers. These partners not only spread the risk but also bring commitment to the table.

## A Global View of Operations and Supply Chain

MY: China is good at producing household item

An effective operation management effort must have a mission so it knows where it is going and a strategy so it knows how to get there. This is the case for a small domestic organization as well as a large international organization

Economic success, indeed survival, is the result of identifying missions to satisfy a customer's needs and wants. We define the organizatino's mission as its purpose--what it will contribute to society. Mission statement provide boundaries and focus for organizations and the concept around which the firm can rally. The mission states the rationale for the organization's existence.

One an organization's mission has been decided, each functional area within the firm determines its supporting mission, such as the major disciplines like marketing, finance/accounting, production/operation.

With the mission established, strategy and its implementatino can begin. Strategy is an organization's action plan to achieve the mission. Each functional area has a strategy for achieving its mission and for helping the organization reach teh overall mission. These strategies exploit opportunities and strengths, neutralize threats, and avoid weakness.

Firms achieve mission in three conceptual ways: differentiation, cost leader, response

* Competing on Differentiation: designing and producing reliable state-of-the-art glove: thereby differentiating itself; differentiation is concened with providing uniqueness; sometimes it may be the convenience of a broad product line, product features, or a service related to the product. Such services can manifest themselves through convenience, training, product delivery and installation, or repair and maintenance services; in service sector, differentiation means through an experience
* Competiting in cost: an effectively matched capacity to demand and effectively utilized this capacity; identifying the optimum investment allows firms to spread overhead costs
* Competing on Response: ability to match changes in a marketplace where design innovation and volume fluctuate substantially; realiability of scheduling

# Chapter 7: Process Strategy
* Process focus: low volume, high varity, like a job shop, different department devoted to welding,grinding and painting, or in an office, accounts payable, sales, and payroll, or in a restaurant, bar, grill, and bakery. Disadvantage: process focused facilities have high variable cost with extremely low utilization of facilities. 
* Repetitive focus: use modules. Modules are parts or components previously prepared, often in a continuous process.
* product focus: high volume, low variety. Also known as continuous process, because they have very long, continuous production runs. It's only with standardization and effective quality control that firms have established product focused facilities. The specialized nature of the facility requires high fixed cost, but low variable costs reward igh facility utilization
* Mass customization: rapid, low-cost production. Mass customization is not just about variety; it is about making precisely what the customer wants when the customer wants it economically. It requires sophisticated operational capabilities. SKIP 

###### Service Blueprinting
* IMPORTANT: level 1: customer is in control; level 2: customer may interact with service provider; level 3: service is removed from customer's control and interaction.

## Customer Interaction and Process Design
* for mass service and professional service, labour content is high, the manager should focus extensively on human resources. This is often done with personalized services, requiring high labor involvement and therefore significant selection and training issues in the human resources area 
* For low customization tends to 1. standardize or restrict some offering, as do fast food restaurant; 2. automate; 3. remove some service. Offloading some aspect of the service through automation may require innovations in process design as well as capital investment 
* because customer feedback is lower in low customization, tight control may be required to maintain quality standards
* operation with low labor intensity may lend themselves particularly well to innovation in process technology and scheduling.

###### Techniques for innovative process design in services
* separation: Structuring service so customers must go where the service is offered. Bank customers go to a manager to open a new account, to loan officers for loans, and to tellers for deposits 
* self-service: self service so customers examine, compare, and evaluate at their own pace: supermarkets and department stores using internet ordering 
* postponement: customizing at delivery: customizing vans at delivery rather than at production 
* focus : restricting the offerings: limited menu restaurant 
* modules: modular selection of service: investment and insurance selection; modular production: prepackaged food modules in restaurant 
* Automation: separating services that may lend themselves to some type of automation: automated teller machine 
* Scheduling: precise personnel scheduling: scheduling ticket counter personnel at 15 minute intervals at airlines 
* training: clarifying the serivce option: investment counsellor, funeral director; explaining how to avoid problem; after sale maintenance personnel

Methods of Evaluating Location Alternatives: Factor Rating Method, Location Break-even Analysis, Centre-of-gravity method, transportation model(linear programming)

## Service Location Strategy
While the focus in industrial-sector location analysis is on minimizing cost, the focus in the service sector is on maximizing revenue. This is because manufacturing firms find that costs tend to vary substantially among locations, while service firms find the location often has more impact on revenue than cost. This means that the location focus for service firms should be on determining the volume of business and revenue.

There are eight major determinants of volume and revenue for the service firm:
1. purchasing power of the customer-drawing area 
2. Service and image compatibility with demographics of customer-drawing area
3. Competition in the area 
4. Quality of the competition 
5. Uniqueness of the firm's and competitors' locations 
6. Physical qualities of facilities and neighbouring businesses 
7. Operating policies of the firm 
8. Quality of management

# Chapter 9: Layout Strategy 
Mcdonald: indoor seating(1950) and drive-through window(1970), and adding play area was a layout issue. Adding breakfast to the menu(1980) was a product strategy. A radically new redesign of the kitchen to faciliate mass customization process(1990). In 2004, a new food ordering layout, the self-service kiosk. Now 2019, deals with the restaurant layout, redesigning all 30000 eateries around the globe to take on a 21st century look.

Layout is one of the key decisions that determines the long-run efficiency of operations. Layout has numerous strategic implications because it establishes an organization's competitive priorities in regard to capacity, processes, flexibility, and cost, as well as quality of work life, customer contact, and image.

An effective layout can help an organization achieve a strategy that supports differentiation, low cost, or response. Benetton, supports a differentiation strategy by havy investment in warehouse layouts that contribute to fast, accurate sorting and shipping to its 5000 outlets. Walmart store layouts support a strategy of low cost, as do its warehouse layout. Hallmark's office layout, where many professionals operate with open communication in work cells, support rapid development of greeting cards. The objective of layout strategy is to develop an effective and efficient layout that meet the firm's competitive requirements.

In all cases, layout design must consider how to achieve the following:
-High utilization of space, equipment, and people    
-Improved flow of information, materials, and people    
-Improve employee morale and safer working conditions    
-Improve customer/client interaction    
-Flexibility(whatever the layout is now, it will need to change)    

### Types of layout 
* Office layout: position workers, their equipment, and space/offices to provide for movement of information 
* Retail layout: Allocate shelf space and responds to customer behavior.
* Warehouse layout: Addresses trade-offs between space and material handling 
* Fixed-position layout: addresses the layout requirements of large, bulky projects such as ships and building 
* Process-oriented layout: deal with low-volume, high-variety production (also called job shop or intermittent production) 
* Work-cell layout: arrange machinery and equipment to focus on production of a single product or group of related products 
* Product-oriented layout: seeks the best personnel and machine utilization in repetitive or continuous production

SKIP 

# Chapter 10: Human Resources, Job Design and Work measurement
* Good human esource strategies are expensive, difficult to achieve, and hard to sustain
* The objective of a human resource strategy is to manage labour and design jobs so people are effectively and efficiently utilized.
* As we focus on a human resource strategy, we want to ensure that people:1. are efficiently utilized within the constraints of other operations management decision; 2. have a reasonable quality of work life in an atmosphere of mutual commitment and trust
* by reasonable quality of work life, we mean a job that is not only reasonable safe and ofr which the pay is equitable but that also achieves an appropriate level of both physical and psychological requirement
* mutal trust is reflected in reasonable, documented employment policies that are honestly and equitably implemented to the satisfaction of both management and employee.

### Labour Planning 
* Labor planning is determining staffing policies that deal with 1. employment stability, 2. work schedule, 3. work rule 

### Job Design 
* Job design specifies the tasks that constitute a job for an individual or a group. We examine five components of job design: 1. job specialization, 2. Job expansion, 3. psychological component, 4. self-directed team, 5. motivation and incentive system

SKIM: the rest of the chapter is about work, workplace environment, time, quality

# Chapter 11: Supply Chain Management 
* supplier qualifcation, product tracking, independent audits, just-in-time delivery
* Most firms spend a huge portion of their sales dollars on purchases. Because an increasing percentage of an organization's cost are determined by purchasing, relationships with suppliers are increasingly integrated and long term.
* Supply Chain Management is the integration of the activities that procure materials and services, transform them into intermediate goods and final products, and deliver them to customers.
* Supply Chain Risk: SKIM
* Ethics and Sustainability: SKIM
* Supply Chain Strategies: one strategy is to negotiate with many suppliers and playing one supplier against another. Second Strategy is to develop long term partnering relationships with a few suppliers to satisfy the end customer. A third strategy is vertical integration, in which a firm decides to use vertical backward integration by actually buying the supplier. A fourth approach is some type of collaboration that allows two or more firms to combine resource--typically in what is called a joint venture--to produce a component. A fifth variation is a combination of few suppliers and vertical integration, known as keiretsu. Finally, a sixth strategy is to develop virtual companies that use suppliers on an as-needed basis. SKIM
* Managing the Supply Chain: Mutual agreement on goals, trust, compatible organizational cultures
* Issues in an integrated supply chain. 1. Local optimization: members of the chain are inclined to focus on maximizing local profit or minimizing immediate cost based on their limited knowledge. It makes fluctuation even bigger. 2. Incentives(Sales incentives, quantity discounts, quotas, and promotions): Incentives push merchandise into the chain for sales that have not occured. This generates fluctuations that are ultimately expensive to all members of the chain. 3. Large lot: it drives down unit shipping and production costs but fail to reflect actual sales and increased holding costs.
* Bullwhip effect: SKIM
* Opportunities in an integrated supply chain: accrurate "pull" data, lot-size reduction, single-stage control of replenishment, vendor-managed inventory, collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment, blanket orders, standardization, postponement, dropshipping and special packaging, pass-through facility, channel assembly: SKIM
* Eprocurement: uses the internet to facilitate purchasing. Eprocurement speeds purchasing, reduces costs, and integrates the supply chain, enhancing an organization's competitive advantage. The traditional supply chain is full of paper transactions, such as requisitions, requests for bids, bid evaluations, purchase orders, order releases, receiving documents, invoices, and the issuance of cheques. Eprocurement reduces this barrage of paperword and at the same time provides purchasing personnel with an extensive database of vendor, delivery and quality data. With this history, vendor selection has improved. MY: basically Procurify.
* Electronic ordering and funds transfer: SKIM
* Online Catalogues: SKIM 
* Auction: SKIM
* RFQs: SKIM
* Real-time Inventory Tracking: SKIM

MY: Operation management is hugely related to product in the supply chain, and it is less related to operation in a service. Company like the Gap, or P&G, but these company works closely with marketing and accounting, but it is operation and marketing heavy. Hewlett-Packard, engineering and operation heavy. IKEA is operation and capentering heavy.

###### Vendor Selection 
* Three stage process of vendor selection: 1. vendor evaluation, 2. vendor development, 3. negotiation
* Vendor evaluation involves finding potential vendors and determining the likelihood of their becoming good suppliers. This phase requires the development of evaluation criteria.
* Vendor Development: Assuming that a firm wants to proceed with a particular vendor, how does it integrate this supplier into its system. The buyer makes sure the vendor has an appreciation of quality requirements, product specifications, schedules and delivery, the purchaser's payment system, and procurement policies.
* Negotiation: the negotiations often focus on quality, delivery, payment, and cost. We will look at three classic types of negotiation strategies: the cost-based price model, the market-based price model, and competitive bidding.
* cost-based price model: requires the supplier open its books to the purchaser. The vcontract price is then based on time and materials or on a fixed cost with an escalation clause to accommodate changes in the vendor's labor and material cost 
* market based price model: price is based on a published, auction, or index price. Many commodities(agriculture products, paper, metal, etc) are priced this way. Bharat Book Bureau(www.bharatbook.com) or www.statcan.gc.ca
* competitive bidding: when suppliers are not willing to discuss costs or where near-perfect markets do not exist, competitive bidding is often appropriate. Infrequent work(such as construction, tooling, and dies) is usually purchased based on a bid. Bidding may take place via mail, fax, or an internet auction. Competitive bidding is the typical policy in many firms for the majority of their purchases. Bidding policies usually require that the purchasing agent have several potential suppliers of the product and quotations from each. The major disadvantage is the hinderance of long term relations between buyer and seller
* A fourth approach is to combine two or more of these techniques. The supplier and purchaser may agree on review of certain cost data, accept some form of market data for raw material costs, or agree that the supplier will remain competitive. In any case, a good supplier relationship one in which both partners have established a degree of mutual trust and a belief in each other's competence, honesty, and fair dealing.
* Contracting: SKIM
* Centralized Purchasing: Companies with multiple facilities(e.g. multiple manufacturing plants or multiple retail outlets) must determine which items to purchase centrally and which to allow local sites to purchase for themselves. Unmonitored decentralized purchasing can create havoc. For example, different plants for Nestle USA's brands used to pay 29 different prices for its vanilla ingredient to the same supplier. Important cost, efficiency and "single-voice" benefits often accrue from a centralized purchasing function. Typical benefits include: 1. leverage purchase volume for better pricing, 2. Develop specialized staff expertise., 3. Develop stronger supplier relationships, 4. Maintain professional control over the purchasing process, 5. Devote more resources to the supplier selection and negotiation process, 6. Reduce the duplication of tasks, 7. Promote standardization
* E-procurement: online catalogues and exchanges, online auctions

###### Logistics Management
* Procurement activities may be combined with various shipping, warehousing, and inventory activities to form a logistics system. The purpose of logistics management is to obtain efficiency of operation through the integration of all material acqisition, movement, and storage activities. When transportation and inventory costs are substantial on both the input and output sides of the production process, an emphasis on logistics may be appropriate. When logistics issues are significant or expensive, many firms opt for outsourcing the logistics function. Logistics specialist can often bring expertise not available inhouse. For instance, logistics companies often have tracking technology that reduces transportation losses and supports delivery schedules that adhere to precise delivery windows. The potential for competitive advantage is found via both reduced costs and improved customer service.
* Firms recognize that the distribution of goods to and from their facilities can represent as much as 25% of the cost of products. 
* Distribution system: 1. Trucking: The vast majority of manufactured goods moves by truck. 2. Railroad: Every year, Canadian rail moves over 70 million people and 70% of all surface good. With the growth of JIT, however, rail transport has been teh biggest lsoer because small-batch manufacture requires frequent, smaller shipments that are likely to move via truck or air; 3. 
Airfreight: airfreight represents less than 5% of tonnage shipped in Canada. However, the recent proliferation of airfreight carriers, such as Purolator, FedEx, UPS, and HDL, makes it a fast-growing mode of shipping. Clearly, for national and international movement of lightweight items--such as medical and emergency suppliers, flowers, fruites, and electronic components, airfreight offers speed and reliability, 4. Waterway: Waterwas are one of the nation's oldest means of freight transportation. Internationally, millions of containers are shipped at very low cost via huge oceangoing ships each year; 5. Pipelines: pipelines are an important form of transporting crude oil, natural gas, and other petroleum and chemical product; 6. Multimodal: MY: Just use multiple methods at the same time
* Warehousing: Warehouses come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny rooms in the back of a store to enormous facilities that could fit multiple football fields. Warehouses may be extremely expensive to operate, but the alternatives may be much more costly. The fundamental purpose of a warehouse is to store goods. However, some warehouses also provide other crucial functions. For example, a warehouse can serve as a consolidation point, gathering shipments from multiple sources to send outbound in one cheaper, fully loaded truck. Alternatively, a warehouse can provide a break-bulk function by accepting a cheaper full truckload inbound shipment and then dividing it for distribution to individual sites. Further, similar to a major airport hub, a warehouse can serve simply as a cross-docking facility--accepting shipments from a variety of sources and recombining them for distribution to a variety of destinations, often without actually storing any goods during the transition. Finally, a warehouse can serve as a point of postponement in the process, providing final customer-specific value-added processing to the product before final shipment.
* Third-Party Logistics: SKIM 
* Question: Determining Daily Cost of Holding: a shipment can be one day faster for 20 dollar more, will you use this method? Answer: No, see text for detail. (PS: However, it will be radically different if the one-day delay in getting the connectors to Singapore delays delivery or delays payment of a $150000 final product. Even one day's interest on 150000 or an angry customer makes a saving of $18.08 insignificant.)
* Security and JIT: SKIM

###### Measuring Supply Chain Performance 
* See [All the Math]
* The SCOR Model. In addition to the metrics presented above, the Supply Chain Council has developed 200 process elements, 550 metrics, and 500 best practices. The SCC(www.supply-chain.org, www.supplychaincanada.org) is a 900-member not-for-profit association for the improvement of supply chain effectiveness. The council has developed the five-part Supply Chain Operation Reference(SCOR) model. 

###### Case Study

# Supplement 11: Supply Chain Management Analytics
* MY: it's kind of nonsense, where do they get the number of probability. It's probably for someone with strong Ti, a INTP or ISTP
* But the risk management is one of the factor that needs to be considered
* the second thing needed to be considered is the bullwhip effect: Bullwhip fluctuation create unstable production schedules, resulting in expensive capacity change adjustment such as overtime, subcontracting, extra inventory, backorders, hiring and laying off of workers, equipment additions, underutilization, longer lead times, or obsolescence of overproduced items.

# Inventory Management
* Inventory management provides competitive advantage at Amazon.com: When Jeff Bezos opened his revolutionary business in 1995, Amazon.com was intended to be a "virtual" retailer--no inventory, no warehouses, no overhead--just a bunch of computers taking orders for books and authorizing others to fill them. Things clearly didn't work out that way. Now, amazon stocks millions of items of inventory, amid hundreds of thousands of bins on shelves in over 150 warehouses around the world. Additionally, Amazon's software is so good that Amazon sells its order taking, processing, and billing expertise to others. It is estimated that 200 million items are now available via the Amazon website. Bezos expects the customer experience at Amazon to be one that yields the lowest price, the fastest delivery, and an error-free order fulfillment process so no other contact with Amazon is necessary. Exchange and returns are very expensive.
* Managing the massive inventory precisely is the key for amazon to be the world-class leader in warehouse automation and management. The time to receive, process, and position the stock in storage and to then accurately "pull" and package an order requires a labor investment of less than three minutes. And 70% of these orders are multiproduct orders. This underlines the high benchmark that Amazon has achieved. This is a world-class performance.
* 1. You order three items, and a computer in Seattle takes charges. A computer assigns your order--a book, a game, and a digital camera--to one of Amazon's massive U.S distribution centres. 2. The "flow meister" at the distribution centre receives your order. She determines which workers go where to fill your order. 3. Amazon's current system doubles the picking speed of manual operators and drops the error rate to nearly zero. 4. Your items ar put into crates on moving belt. Each item goes into a large yellow crate that contains many customers' orders. When full, the crates ride a series of conveyor belts that wind more than 10 miles through the plant at a constant speed of 2.9 feet per second. The barcode of each item is scanned 15 times, by machines and by many  of the 600 workders. The goal is to reduce erros to zero--returns are very expensive; 5. All thre items converge in a chute and then inside a box. All the crates arrive at a central point where barcodes are matched with order numbers to determine who gets what. Your three items end up in a 3-foot-wide chute--one of several thousand--and are placed in a corrugated box with a new barcode that identifies your order. Picking is sequenced to reduce operator travel; 6. Any gifts you've chosen are wrapped by hand. Amazon trains an elite group of gift wrappers, each of whom processes 30 packages an hour; 7. The box is packed, taped, weighed, and labelled before leaving the warehouse in a truck. A typical plant is designed to ship as many as 200,000 pieces a day. About 60% of orders are shipped via the postal service; nearly everything else goes through United Parcel Service; 8. Your order arrives at your doorstep. In one or two days, your order is delivered.
* As Amazon.com well knows, inventory is one of the most expensive assets of many companies, representing as much as 50% of total invested capital. Operations managers around the globe have long recognized that good inventory management is crucial. On the one hand, a firm can reduce costs by reducing inventory. On the other hand, production may stop and customers become dissatisfied when an item is out of stock. The objective of inventory management is to strike a balance between invetory investment and customer service.
* All organizations have some type of inventory planning and control system. A bank has methods to control its inventory of cash. A hospital has methods to control blood supplies and pharmaceuticals. Government agencies, schools, and virtually every manufacturing and production organization are concerned with inventory planning and control.
* In cases of phsyical products, the organization must determine whether to produce goods or to purchase them. Once this decision has been made, the next step is to forecast demand, as discussed in Chapter 4. Forecasting. In this chapter, we discuss the functions, types, and management of inventory. We then address two basic inventory issues: how much to order and when to order.

###### Functions of Inventory 
Inventory can serve several functions that add flexibility to a firm's operation. The four functions of inventory are: 1. To "decouple" or separate various parts of the production process. For example, if a firm's supplies fluctuate, extra inventory may be necessary to decouple the production process from suppliers. 2. To decouple the firm from fluctuations in demand and provide a stock of goods that will provide a selection for customers. Such inventories are typical  in retail establishments; 3. To take advantage of quantity discounts, because purchases in large quantities may reduce the cost of goods or their delivery. 4. To hedge against inflation and upward price changes

###### Types of Inventory 
To accommodate the funcitons of inventory, firms maintain four types of inventories 1. raw material inventory; 2. work in process inventory; 3. maintenance/repair/operating supply inventory and 4. finished good inventory.

###### Managing Inventory 
* ABC analysis: see [All the math]. The objective is to separate the important from the unimportant. The idea is that, Class A items are those on which the annual dollar volume is high. Although such items may represent only about 15% of the total inventory items, they represent 70% to 80% of the total dollar usage. Class B items are those inventory items of medium annual dollar volume. Those with low annual dollar volume are Class C, which may represent only 5% of the annual dollar volume but about 55% of the total inventory items.
* Criteria other than annual dollar volume can determine item classification. For instance, anticipated engineering changes, delivery problems, quality problems, or high unit cost may dictate upgrading items to a higher classification. The advantage of dividing inventory items into classes allows policies and controls to be established for each class.
* Policies that may be based on ABC analysis include the following: 1. Purchasing resources expended on supplier development should be much higher for individual A items than for C items; 2. A items, as opposed to B and C items, should have tighter physical inventory control, perhaps they belong in a more secure area, and perhaps the accuracy of inventory records for A items should be verified more frequently; 3. Forecasting A items may warrant more care than forecasting other items. || Better forecasting, physical control, supplier reliability, and an ultimate reduction in safety stock can all result from appropriate inventory management policies.
* record accuracy: SKIM
* Cycle Counting: SKIM
* A items will be counted frequently, perhaps once a month; B items will be counted less frequently, perhaps once a quarter; and C items will be counted perhaps once every six months.
* MY: Operation Management is a very Si-Te activity.
* Control of service inventory: SKIP

###### Inventory Models 
* Independent versus depedent demand: SKIM 
* Holding, ordering, and setup cost: SKIM

###### Inventory Models for Independent Demand 
There are three inventory models that address two important questions: when to order and how much to order. They are: 1. Basic economic order quantity (EOQ) model, 2. Production order quantity model; 3. Quantity discount model
* The economic order quantity model is one of the most commonly used inventory control techniques. This techniques is relatively easy to use but is based on several assumption: 1. Demand for an item is known, reasonably constant, and independent of decisions for other items; 2. Lead time--that is, the time between placement and receipt of the order--is known and consistent; 3. Receipt of inventory is instantaneous and complete. In other words, the inventory from an order arrives in one batch at one time; 4. Quantity discounts are not possible; 5. The only variable costs are the cost of setting up or placing an order and the cost of holding or storing inventory over time; 6. Stockout(shortage) can be completely avoided if orders are placed at the right time. See graph in the book page 479.
* Minimizing Cost: see [All the math]
* Production order quantity model: In previous inventory model, we assumed that the entire inventory order was received at one time. There are times, however, when the firm may receive its inventory over a period of time. such cases require a different model, one that does not require the instantaneous-receipt assumption. This model is applicable under two situation: 1. when inventory continuously flows or builds up over a period of time after an order has been placed, or 2. when units are proudced and sold simultaneously. Under these circumstance, we take into account the daily production rate and the daily demand rate. Because this model is especially suitable for the production environment. It is commonly called the production order quantity model

# Chapter 13: Aggregate Planning and Sales and operation Planning
In chapter 4, we saw the demand forecasting can address long-, medium-, and short-range decision. Long-range forecasts, the responsibility of top management, provide data for a firm's multiyear plans. These long-range plans require policies and strategies related to issues such as capacity and capital investment(supplement 7), facility location(chapter 8), new product(chapter 5), and processes(chapter 7), and supply chain management(chapter 11). Intermediate plans are designed to be consistent with top management's long-range plans and strategy, and work within the reousrce constraints determined by earlier strategic decision. The challenge is to have these plans match production to the ever-changing demands of the market. Intermediate plans are the job of the operations manager, working with other functional areas of the firm. In this chapter we deal with intermediate plans, typically measured in months. Short-range plans are usually for less than three months. These plans are also the responsibility of operations personnel. Operations manager work with supervisors to translate the intermediate plan into short-term plans consisting of weekly, daily, and hourly schedules. Intermediate planning is initiated by a process known as sales and operations planning (S&OP)

###### Sales and Operation Planning
* Good intermediate planning requires the coordination of demand forecasts with functional areas of a firm and its supply chain. And because each functional part of a firm and the supply chain has its own limitation and constraints, the coordination can be difficult. This coordinated planning effort has evolved into a process known as sales and operations planning. S&OP receives input from a variety of sources both internal and external to the firm. Because of the diverse input, S&OP is typically done by cross-functional teams that align the competing constraints.
* One of the tasks of S&OP is to determine which plans are feasible in the coming months and which are not. Any limitations, both within the firm and in the supply chain, must be reflected in an intermediate plan that bring day-to-day and operaitonal realties together. When the resources appear to be substantially at odds with market expectations, S&OP provides advance warning to top management. If the plan can not be implemented in the short run, the planning exercise is useless. And if the plan can not be supported in the long run, strategic changes need to be made. To keep aggregate plan current and to support its intermediate planning role, S&OP uses rolling forecasts that are frequently updated--often weekly or monthly.
* The output of S&OP is called an aggregate plan. The aggregate plan is concerned with determining the quantity and timing of production for the intermediate future, often from 3 to 18 months ahead. Aggregate plans use information regarding families or product lines rather than individual products. These plans are concerned with the total, or aggregate, or the individual product lines.
* Different company has different planning focus. For example, some company may use S&OP with a focus on production decisions; some company may focus S&OP on supply chain and inventory decisions; while some company tends to have its S&OP focus on its critical and expensive investment in capacity. In all cases, though, the decision must be tied to strategic planning and integrated with all areas of the firm over all planning horizons. Specifically, S&OP is aimed at 1. the coordinationand integration of the internal and external resources necessary for a successful aggregat plan and 2. communicaiton of the plan to those charged with its execution. An added advantage of an aggregate plan is that it can be an effective tool to engage members of the supply chain in achieving the firm's goal.
* Besides being representative, timely, and comprehensive, an effective S&OP process needs these four additional features to generate a useful aggregate plan: 1. a logical unit for measuring sales and output, such as pounds of Darito at Frito-Lay, air-conditioning units at GE, or terabytes of storage at Rackspace. 2. A forecast of demand for a reasonable intermediate planning period in aggregate terms, 3. A method to determine the relevant costs, 4. A model that combines forecasts and costs so scheduling decisions ca nbe made for the planning period
* In this chapter, we describe several techniques that managers use when developing an aggregate plan for both manufacturing and service sector firms. For manufactureers, an aggregate schedule ties a firm's strategic goals to production plans. For service organizaitons, an aggregate schedule ties strategic goals to workforce schedules.

###### The Nature of Aggregate Planning 
* As the term aggregate implies, an aggregate plan means combining appropriate resources into general, or overal, terms, Given demand forecast, facility capacity, inventory levels, workforce size, and related inputs, the planner has to select the rate of output for a facility over the next three to 18 months. The plan can be for firms such as Frito-Lay and Whirlpool, hospital, colleges, or Pearson.
* For example, if a company is producing mower, you will notice that its plan looks at production in the aggregate(the family of mowers), not as a product-by-product breakdown. Same for automotive company will say how many cars to make but not how many should be two-door versus four door, etc. In short, no detail.
* Aggregate planning is part of a larger production planning system. Therefore, understanding the interfaces between the plan and several internal and external factors is useful. The operations manager not only receives input from the marketing department's demand forecast but must also deal with financial data, personnel, capacity, and availability of raw materials. In a manufacturing environment, the process of breaking the aggregate plan down into greater detail is called [term] disaggregation. Disaggregation results in a master production schedule, which provides input to material requirement planning (MRP) systems. The master production schedule addresses the purchasing or production of parts or components needed to make final product (chapter 14). Detail work schedules for people and priority scheduling for products result as the final step of the production planning system (chapter 15)

###### Responsibility and planning tasks and time horizons
* Top executive: Long-range plans(over 1 year)+a bit of intermediate-range plans(3 to 18 months). Long term: capacity decisions(supplement 7) are critical to long-range plans. Issues: research and development, new product plans, capital investment, facility location/capacity 
* Operaitons manager with sales and operations planning team: Intermediate planning (3-18 months) with a bit of short-range plans(up to 3 months). Intermediate-range plans: The aggregate planning techniques of this chapter help managers build intermediate-range plans. Issues: sales and operation planning, production planning and budgeting, setting employment, inventory, subcontracting levels, analyzing operating plans
* Operations managers, supervisors, foreman: short-range plans(up to 3 months): the scheduling techniques (chapter 15) help managers prepare short-range plans. Issues: job assignments, ordering, job scheduling, dispatching, overtime, part-time help.
* MY: geez, I have no interest in taking part in all of these.

###### Aggregate Planning Strategies
* When generating an aggregate plan, the operations manager must answer several questions: 1. should inventories be used to absorb changes in demand during the planning period? 2. Shuld changes be accommodated by varying the size of the workforce? 3. Should part-timers be used, or should overtime and idle time absort fluctuation? 4. Should subcontractors be used on fluctuating orders so a stable workforce can be maintained? 5. Should prices or other factors be changed to influence demand?
* All of these are legitmate planning strategies. They involve the manipulation of inventory, production rates, labour levels, capacity, and other controllable variables. We will now examine eight options in more detail. 

###### Capacity Options 
1. Changing inventory levels: Managers can increase inventory during periods of low demand to meet high demand in future periods. If this strategy is selected, cost associated with storage, insurance, handing, obsolescence, pilferage, and capital invested will increase. On the other hand, with low inventory on hand and increasing demand, shortage can occur, resulting in longer lead times and poor customer service 
2. Varying workforce size by hiring or layoff: One way to meet demand is to hire or lay off production workers to match produciton rates. However, new employees need to be trained, and productivity drops temporarily as they are absorbed into the workforce. Layoffs or terminations lower the morale of all workers, and also lead to lower productivity.
3. Varying production rates through overtime or idle time: keeping a constant workforce while varying working hours may be possible. Yet when demand is on a large upswing, there is alimit on how much overtime is realisitic. Overtime pay increases costs and too much overtime can result in worker fatigue and a drop in productivity. Overtime also implies added overhead costs to keep a facility open. On the other hand, when there is a period of decreased demand, the company must somehow absorb workers' idle time--often a difficult and expensive process
4. Subcontracting: a firm can acquire temporary capacity by subcontracting work during peak demand periods. Subcontracting has several pitfalls, however: it may be costly; it risks opening the door to a competitor; and developing the perfect subcontract supplier can be a challenge.
5. Using part-time worker: Especially in the service sector, part-time worker can fill labour needs. This practice is common in restaurants, retail stores, and supermarkets.

###### Demand Options
1. Influencing demand: When demand is low, a company can try to increase demand through advertising, promotion, personal selling, and price cuts. For example, airlines and hotels have long offered weekend discounts and off-season rates; some electricity providers charge less in off-peak times; some colleges and university give discounts to senior citizens; and air-conditioners are least expensive in winter. However, even special advertising, promotions, selling, and pricing are not always able to balance demand with production capacity.
2. Backordering during high-demand periods: Backorders are orders for goods or service that a firm accepts but is unable (either on purpose or by chance) to fill at the moment. If customers are willing to wait without loss of their goodwill or order, backordering is a possible strategy. Many firms backorder, but the approach often results in lost sales. 
3. Counter-seasonal product and service mixing: A widely used active smoothing technique among manufactureers is to develop a product mix of counter-seasonal items. Examples include companies that make both furnaces and air conditioners or lawn mowers and snowblowers. However, companies that follow this approach may find themselves involved in products or services beyond their area of expertise or beyond their target market.

* Changing inventory level: adv: Change in human resource are gradual or none; no abrupt production changes; disadvantage: inventory holding costs may increase; shortage may result in lost sales; comment: applies mainly to production, not service, operation 
* Varying workforce size by hiring or layoff: adv: avoid the cost of other alternatives; disadv: hiring, layoff, and training cost may be significant; comment: use where size of labour pool is large
* Varying production rates through overtime or idle time: adv: matches seasonal fluctuations without hiring/training costs; disadv: overtime premiums; tired workers; may not meet demand; comment: allows flexibility within the aggregate plan
* Subcontracting: Adv: Permits flexibility and smoothing of the firm's output; disadv: loss of quality control; reduced profits; loss of future business; comment: applies mainly in production settings
* Using part-time worker: is less costly and more flexibly than full-time worker. High turnover/training costs; quality suffers; scheduling difficult; comment: good for unskilled jobs in areas with large temporary labour pool
* Influencing demand: adv: tries to use excess capacity. Discounts draw new customer; disadv: uncertainty in demand. Hard to match demand to supply exactly; comment: Create marketing ideas. Overbooking used in some business 
* Backordering during high-demand periods: adv: may avoid overtime. Keep capacity constant; disadv: customer must be willing to wait, but goods is lost; comment: many companies backorder 
* counter-seasonal product and service mixing: fully utilizes resources allows stable workforce. Disadv: may require skills or equipment outside firm's area of expertise; comment: risky finding products or services with opposite demand pattern
* the case strategy: this strategy attemps to achieve output rates for each period that match the demand forecast for that period. This strategy can be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, the operations manager can vary workforce levels by hiring or laying off or can vary production by means of overtime, idle time, part-time employees, or subcontracting. Many service organizations favor the chase strategy because the changing inventory levels option is difficult or impossible to adopt. Industries that have moved toward a chase strategy include education, hospitality, and construction.
* Level strategy(level scheduling): is an aggregate plan in which production is uniform from period to period. Firms such as Toyota and Nissan attempt to keep production at uniform level and may 1. let the finished goods inventory vary to buffer the difference between demand and production, or 2. find alternative work for employees. Their philosophy is that a stable workforce leads to a better-quality product, less turnover and absenteeism, and more employee commitment to corporate goals. Other hidden saving include employees who are more experienced, easier scheduling and supervision, and fewer dramatic start-ups and shutdowns. Level scheduling works well when demand is reasonable stable

### Methods for Aggregate Planning
* Plan 1: average requirement=total expected demand/number of production days=6200/124=50 complete unit per day
* Plan 2: maintain a constant workforce at a level necessary to meet the lowest demand month and to meet all demand above this level by subcontracting. inventory carrying=9250=1850*$5 per unit; regular-time labour=99200=10*80 per day*124 day; other cost(overtime,hiring, layoff, subcontracting)=0; total=108450; because you keep a constant workforce, you will hire enough people for the lowest demand month, which is March, so its 800/21=7.6 workers. All other demand is met by subcontracting; 
* [continue]: inhouse production=38 unit per day* 124 production days=4712; subcontract unit=6200-4712=1488 units; regular time labor=75392=7.6 workers*$80 per day*124days; subcontracting=29760=1488 units*20 per unit; total cost=105152
* Plan 3: varying the workforce by hiring and layoff as necessary

### Aggregate Planning in Services 
* Demand management takes a more active role. 
* In industries such as banking, trucking, and fast food, aggregate planning may be easier than in manufacturing.
* Controlling the cost of labor in service firms is critical. Successful techniques include: 1. accurate scheduling of labor-hours to assure quick response to customer demand; 2. An on-call labour resource that can be added or deleted to meet unexpected demand; 3. Flexibility of individual worker skills that permits reallocation of available labor; 4. Flexibility in rate of output of hours of work to meet changing demand.
* these options may seem demanding, but they are not unusual in service industires, in which labour is the primary aggregate planning vehicle. For instance: 1. excess capacity is used to provide study and planning time by real estate and auto salespersons; 2. police and fire departments have provisions for calling in off-duty personnel for major emergencies. Where the emergency is extended, police or fire personnel may work longer hours and extra shifts; 3. When business is unexpectedly light, restaurant and retail stores send personnel home early; 4. supermarket stock clerks work cash registers when checkout lines become too lengthy; 5. experienced servers increase their pace and efficiency of service as crowds of customers arrive
