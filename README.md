* To create goods and services, all organizations perform three functions. These funcitons are the necessary ingredients not only for production but also for an organization's survival: 1. Marketing, which generates the demand, or at least takes the order for a product or service; 2. Production/operation: which creates, produces, and delivers the product; 3. Finance/accounting: tracks how well the organization is doing, pays the bills, and collects the money
* [def]supply chain is a global network of organizations and activities that supply a firm with goods and services
* [CL]: Competition in the 21st century is no longer between companies, it is between supply chains
* All good managers perform the basic functions of the management process. The management process consists of planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling.

###### 10 Critical Decisions of Operations Management 
1. Design of goods and services: what good or service should we offer? How should we design these products
2. Managing quality: How do we define the quality? Who is responsible for quality.
3. Process and capacity design: What process and what capacity will these products require? What equipment and technology are necessary for these processes?
4. Location Strategy: Where should we put the facility? On what criteria should we base the location decision?
5. Layout strategy: How should we arrange the facility? How large much the facility be to meet our plan?
6. Human resources and job design: how do we provide a reasonable work environment? How much can we expect our employees to produce?
7. Supply Chain Management: Should we make or buy this component? who should be our suppliers, and how can we integrate them into our strategy?
8. Inventory, material requirements planning and JIT(just in time): How much inventory of each item should we have? When do we reorder?
9. Intermediate and short-term scheduling: Are we better off keeping people on the payroll udring slowdowns? Which job do we perform next?
10. Maintenance: Who is responsible for maintenance?

Frederick W. Taylor believes that management should assume more responsibility for:
1. Matching employees to the right job 
2. Provide the proper training
3. Providing proper work methods and tools
4. Establishing legitimate incentive for work to be accomplished.
