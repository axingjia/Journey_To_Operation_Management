# Chapter 1: Operation and Productivity
* design product, test, and analyze for cost of ingredient
* labor requirement 
* customer satisfaction
* production upon approval, only when the ingredients are available from qualified suppliers 
* receiving, cold storage, grilling or baking or frying
* use the best people they can recruit and train 
* prepare effective employee schedules
* Design efficient layouts

* [def]Production is creation of goods and services
* [def]Operations Management is the set of activities that creates value in the form of goods and services by transforming input into output
* it can be a good, like a Sony TV or a Harley-Davidson motocycle, or a service, like the transfer of funds from a saving account to a chequing account, the transplant of a human organ, the filling of an empty seat on an airplane, or the education of a student

* To create goods and services, all organizations perform three functions. These funcitons are the necessary ingredients not only for production but also for an organization's survival: 1. Marketing, which generates the demand, or at least takes the order for a product or service; 2. Production/operation: which creates, produces, and delivers the product; 3. Finance/accounting: tracks how well the organization is doing, pays the bills, and collects the money
* [def]supply chain is a global network of organizations and activities that supply a firm with goods and services
* [CL]: Competition in the 21st century is no longer between companies, it is between supply chains
* All good managers perform the basic functions of the management process. The management process consists of planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling.

###### 10 Critical Decisions of Operations Management 
1. Design of goods and services: what good or service should we offer? How should we design these products
2. Managing quality: How do we define the quality? Who is responsible for quality.
3. Process and capacity design: What process and what capacity will these products require? What equipment and technology are necessary for these processes?
4. Location Strategy: Where should we put the facility? On what criteria should we base the location decision?
5. Layout strategy: How should we arrange the facility? How large much the facility be to meet our plan?
6. Human resources and job design: how do we provide a reasonable work environment? How much can we expect our employees to produce?
7. Supply Chain Management: Should we make or buy this component? who should be our suppliers, and how can we integrate them into our strategy?
8. Inventory, material requirements planning and JIT(just in time): How much inventory of each item should we have? When do we reorder?
9. Intermediate and short-term scheduling: Are we better off keeping people on the payroll udring slowdowns? Which job do we perform next?
10. Maintenance: Who is responsible for maintenance?

Frederick W. Taylor believes that management should assume more responsibility for:
1. Matching employees to the right job 
2. Provide the proper training
3. Providing proper work methods and tools
4. Establishing legitimate incentive for work to be accomplished.

###### Operations in the Service Sector
* [def] services example: repair and maintenance, government, food and lodging, transportation, insruance, trade, financial, real estate, education, law, medicine, entertainment, health services.
* There is no stored inventory. Therefore, there is no inventory problem in service 
* Service have high customer interaction.
* Services are often knowledge based
* Services are frequently dispersed.

# Chapter 2: Operations Strategy in a Global Environment 
Boeing with new airplane, new design and new engine. Its airplane is built all around the world. Because of that, it raises a huge financial risk of over $5 billion dollars. Because of that Boeing needs partners. It means finding exceptional developers and suppliers. These partners not only spread the risk but also bring commitment to the table.

## A Global View of Operations and Supply Chain

MY: China is good at producing household item

An effective operation management effort must have a mission so it knows where it is going and a strategy so it knows how to get there. This is the case for a small domestic organization as well as a large international organization

Economic success, indeed survival, is the result of identifying missions to satisfy a customer's needs and wants. We define the organizatino's mission as its purpose--what it will contribute to society. Mission statement provide boundaries and focus for organizations and the concept around which the firm can rally. The mission states the rationale for the organization's existence.

One an organization's mission has been decided, each functional area within the firm determines its supporting mission, such as the major disciplines like marketing, finance/accounting, production/operation.

With the mission established, strategy and its implementatino can begin. Strategy is an organization's action plan to achieve the mission. Each functional area has a strategy for achieving its mission and for helping the organization reach teh overall mission. These strategies exploit opportunities and strengths, neutralize threats, and avoid weakness.

Firms achieve mission in three conceptual ways: differentiation, cost leader, response

* Competing on Differentiation: designing and producing reliable state-of-the-art glove: thereby differentiating itself; differentiation is concened with providing uniqueness; sometimes it may be the convenience of a broad product line, product features, or a service related to the product. Such services can manifest themselves through convenience, training, product delivery and installation, or repair and maintenance services; in service sector, differentiation means through an experience
* Competiting in cost: an effectively matched capacity to demand and effectively utilized this capacity; identifying the optimum investment allows firms to spread overhead costs
* Competing on Response: ability to match changes in a marketplace where design innovation and volume fluctuate substantially; realiability of scheduling

# Chapter 7: Process Strategy
* Process focus: low volume, high varity, like a job shop, different department devoted to welding,grinding and painting, or in an office, accounts payable, sales, and payroll, or in a restaurant, bar, grill, and bakery. Disadvantage: process focused facilities have high variable cost with extremely low utilization of facilities. 
* Repetitive focus: use modules. Modules are parts or components previously prepared, often in a continuous process.
* product focus: high volume, low variety. Also known as continuous process, because they have very long, continuous production runs. It's only with standardization and effective quality control that firms have established product focused facilities. The specialized nature of the facility requires high fixed cost, but low variable costs reward igh facility utilization
* Mass customization: rapid, low-cost production. Mass customization is not just about variety; it is about making precisely what the customer wants when the customer wants it economically. It requires sophisticated operational capabilities. SKIP 

###### Service Blueprinting
* IMPORTANT: level 1: customer is in control; level 2: customer may interact with service provider; level 3: service is removed from customer's control and interaction.

## Customer Interaction and Process Design
* for mass service and professional service, labour content is high, the manager should focus extensively on human resources. This is often done with personalized services, requiring high labor involvement and therefore significant selection and training issues in the human resources area 
* For low customization tends to 1. standardize or restrict some offering, as do fast food restaurant; 2. automate; 3. remove some service. Offloading some aspect of the service through automation may require innovations in process design as well as capital investment 
* because customer feedback is lower in low customization, tight control may be required to maintain quality standards
* operation with low labor intensity may lend themselves particularly well to innovation in process technology and scheduling.

###### Techniques for innovative process design in services
* separation: Structuring service so customers must go where the service is offered. Bank customers go to a manager to open a new account, to loan officers for loans, and to tellers for deposits 
* self-service: self service so customers examine, compare, and evaluate at their own pace: supermarkets and department stores using internet ordering 
* postponement: customizing at delivery: customizing vans at delivery rather than at production 
* focus : restricting the offerings: limited menu restaurant 
* modules: modular selection of service: investment and insurance selection; modular production: prepackaged food modules in restaurant 
* Automation: separating services that may lend themselves to some type of automation: automated teller machine 
* Scheduling: precise personnel scheduling: scheduling ticket counter personnel at 15 minute intervals at airlines 
* training: clarifying the serivce option: investment counsellor, funeral director; explaining how to avoid problem; after sale maintenance personnel

# Chapter 8: Location Strategies
Factors that affect location decisions: labour productivity, exchange rate and currency risk, costs, political risk, values, and culture, proximity to markets, proximity to suppliers, poximity to competitors

Methods of Evaluating Location Alternatives: Factor Rating Method, Location Break-even Analysis, Centre-of-gravity method, transportation model(linear programming)

## Service Location Strategy
While the focus in industrial-sector location analysis is on minimizing cost, the focus in the service sector is on maximizing revenue. This is because manufacturing firms find that costs tend to vary substantially among locations, while service firms find the location often has more impact on revenue than cost. This means that the location focus for service firms should be on determining the volume of business and revenue.

There are eight major determinants of volume and revenue for the service firm:
1. purchasing power of the customer-drawing area 
2. Service and image compatibility with demographics of customer-drawing area
3. Competition in the area 
4. Quality of the competition 
5. Uniqueness of the firm's and competitors' locations 
6. Physical qualities of facilities and neighbouring businesses 
7. Operating policies of the firm 
8. Quality of management

# Chapter 9: Layout Strategy 
Mcdonald: indoor seating(1950) and drive-through window(1970), and adding play area was a layout issue. Adding breakfast to the menu(1980) was a product strategy. A radically new redesign of the kitchen to faciliate mass customization process(1990). In 2004, a new food ordering layout, the self-service kiosk. Now 2019, deals with the restaurant layout, redesigning all 30000 eateries around the globe to take on a 21st century look.

Layout is one of the key decisions that determines the long-run efficiency of operations. Layout has numerous strategic implications because it establishes an organization's competitive priorities in regard to capacity, processes, flexibility, and cost, as well as quality of work life, customer contact, and image.

An effective layout can help an organization achieve a strategy that supports differentiation, low cost, or response. Benetton, supports a differentiation strategy by havy investment in warehouse layouts that contribute to fast, accurate sorting and shipping to its 5000 outlets. Walmart store layouts support a strategy of low cost, as do its warehouse layout. Hallmark's office layout, where many professionals operate with open communication in work cells, support rapid development of greeting cards. The objective of layout strategy is to develop an effective and efficient layout that meet the firm's competitive requirements.

In all cases, layout design must consider how to achieve the following:
-High utilization of space, equipment, and people    
-Improved flow of information, materials, and people    
-Improve employee morale and safer working conditions    
-Improve customer/client interaction    
-Flexibility(whatever the layout is now, it will need to change)    

### Types of layout 
* Office layout: position workers, their equipment, and space/offices to provide for movement of information 
* Retail layout: Allocate shelf space and responds to customer behavior.
* Warehouse layout: Addresses trade-offs between space and material handling 
* Fixed-position layout: addresses the layout requirements of large, bulky projects such as ships and building 
* Process-oriented layout: deal with low-volume, high-variety production (also called job shop or intermittent production) 
* Work-cell layout: arrange machinery and equipment to focus on production of a single product or group of related products 
* Product-oriented layout: seeks the best personnel and machine utilization in repetitive or continuous production
